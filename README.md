# DC Events

## This app is not finished and the current styling of the frontend is a work in progress

[DC Events](https://master.d2rk265bz24uxf.amplifyapp.com/) is an app that combines a TypeScript/React frontend, an AWS Lambda function that consists of a series of Python scrapers, an AWS DynamoDB database, and an AWS API Gateway to collect and display upcoming events in Washington D.C.
